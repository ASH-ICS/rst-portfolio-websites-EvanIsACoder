<p> By 2028, the sports betting industry is expected to reach $114.4 billion by 2028, this represents an 86% increase from 2021. This is a massive jump for the sports betting industry as well as the sports industry in general, and it’s not surprising given how sports betting has always been around for a while. with many people betting on their favorite players and teams to make some quick cash or in some cases losing it all when their team or player decides to take a quick nap midgame. However, this is heavily due to the rise of online sports betting.

  With how popular phones are, more and more people are able to connect to apps to do their betting. This is a lot more accessible and easy than visiting a physical bookkeeper to place bets. Being able to track your bets in real time and adjustment is an additional pro to online sports betting, not to mention how you can now place bets during the game itself due to how fast and accessible technology is. Technology has also allowed dedicated fans to research teams and players in order to help them with their betting.

  Electricity Minister Kgosientsho Ramokgopa is especially enthusiastic of the additional generated power, calling the 2500 MW of power a “significant milestone”. Zizamele Mbambo, the energy ministry’s deputy director general of nuclear power told a press briefing that the new nuclear power units should be ready in 2032 or 2033. This likely means that the country will continue to struggle with power cuts for the next decade unless given help. This is unfortunate as  power cuts that have lasted for up to 12 hours a day over the past 15 years have badly impacted the economy and the government which is heading into an election next year.

Online betting has also added flexibility to sports betting. This has made it as popular and exciting as it is today.
